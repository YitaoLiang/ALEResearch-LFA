Adaptive Feature Representation -*- mode: org -*-

* A feature's elements:
  - feature index (so we can use the index to represent features in the list of active features) 
  - Location (this is the anchor pixel):
    + x, y (index for rows and columns)
    + resolutions of x and y
    + color 
  - A list of offsets:
    + each offset is a location 
    + Note the resolution in location is the resolution for the offset
    + How to prevent redundancy?
      - Possible Approach: the offset's color cannot be smaller than the anchor feature's color

* How to preprocess the screen
  - location -> color 
  - color -> locations

* Generate candidate features
